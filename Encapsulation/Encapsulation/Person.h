/*
- Properties are merely a convenient syntax for generating this code (Imagine having to write all of this boilerplate code for every property?
- Notice we are using encapsulation to prevent any object from simply setting or getting _age.
- Objc forces you to encapsulate values as it doesn't let you just expose variables in the interface.

// setter and getter
- (void)setAge:(NSNumber *)age;
- (NSNumber *)age;

// Generates an error because you can't expose a variable in the interface which breaks encapsulation
// NSNumber *someNumber;

// The property is a construct that does the same thing as _age, setAge: and age.
// We can override the setter and getter. Why would we want to do this?
